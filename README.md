# Australian Teacher Shortage
Australia is currently experiencing a shortage of teachers around the country. Government modelling suggests that these shortages could worsen over the coming years, with Australia potentially facing a teacher shortfall of about 4,000 secondary school teachers between 2021 and 2025.​ In response, the Commonwealth has recently released The National Teacher Workforce Action Plan to tackle this issue, and has outlined five priority areas:​

Improving teacher supply​
Strengthening initial teacher education​
Keeping the teachers we have​
Elevating the profession​
Better understanding future teacher workforce needs​
